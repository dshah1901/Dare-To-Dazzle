# Dare to Dazzle - Android App (Team 33)
Dare to Dazzle is an application where we will showcase jewellery. The user can choose from four provided categories of jewellery; “Rings, Earrings, Necklaces and Bracelets”. Each category redirects the user to a list of items of the specific type. The user can choose one of the listed jewellery items and get more information regarding the particular item. Moreover, the user can search up the desired term to get more information about it.

The user would be greeted with a splash screen similar to Fig 1.

Fig 2 shows the Main Activity, which is the landing page of the application. The user can select from the top items displayed or choose from the various categories of jewellery. They can also search items using the search bar.

The user can enter any keyword (e.g.:- Choker), and the search results will be displayed as shown in Fig 3. If no item is found, a proper message will be displayed as shown in Fig 4.

Selecting any one of the categories (e.g.:- Necklaces) will lead the user to the List Activity as shown in Fig 5, where all types of Necklaces are listed for the user to select.

If the user selects one of the categories, it will redirect the user to the Details Activity, and the information for the product will be displayed as shown in Fig 6.
