Dare to Dazzle is an application where we will showcase jewellery. The user can choose from four provided categories of jewellery; “Rings, Earrings, Necklaces and Bracelets”. Each category redirects the user to a list of items of the specific type. The user can choose one of the listed jewellery items and get more information regarding the particular item. Moreover, the user can  view the most clicked items on the landing page and also search up any desired term to get more information about it. For this project, Dhvani was the Developer 1 and Pooja was the Developer 2.
